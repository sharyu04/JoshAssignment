2. How to setup multiple remote repositories for the same project? Explain the use case

To set up a remote repository the command used is " git remote add <remote-id> <remote-url> ".
We can setup such multiple remote repositories:
# Adding first remote repopository
" git add remote origin1 git@github.com:sharyu04/JoshAssignment.git "
# Adding second remote repository
" git add remote origin2 git@github.com:Rutuja2024/RJPOLICE_HACK_599_Troubleshooters_07.git "
#View list of all remote repositories
" git remote -v "

One of the usecase of multiple remote repositories can be opensource packages where partial data is public and partial is private. In that case two different public and private repositories can be added. One more usecase can be when there are different repos for development, deplyoment, etc.
