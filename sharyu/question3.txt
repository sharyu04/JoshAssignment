3. How to combine two commits in one commit? For Example, you have 4 different commits C1, C2, C3, and C4 and you need to combine C2 and C3 into one single commit

Squash is used to combine multiple commits into one commit.
Steps:
1. Run git rebase in interactive mode
" git rebase -i HEAD~4 "
This will open a interactive window that will display the last 4 commits in the format:
pick <commit-id> <commit-message>
In this case the window will display data such as:
pick <commit-id1> C1
pick <commit-id2> C2
pick <commit-id3> C3
pick <commit-id4> C4

2. Replace 'pick' with 'squash' or 's' to combine the commit with its previous commit. Here, we need to combine C3 and C2. Hence:
pick <commit-id1> C1
pick <commit-id2> C2
squash <commit-id3> C3
pick <commit-id4> C4
This will combine C3 with C2.

3. After saving the above file one more window will popup to choose betwwen the commit message. You can go with the default message or add a custom message.

4.Run git push to add new commit to the remote origin
