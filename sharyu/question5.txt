Difference between --force push and --force-with-lease, You have to show the use of both, also you have to show in what senario --force-with-lease is used?

--force push overwrites the remote branch with you local branch, ignoring any conflicts between the two branches.
The command to use it is "git push --force"

--force-wiht-lease allows you to push changes to the remote branch only if the remote branch is at the same commit as the one you have locally.
The command to use it is "git push --force-with-lease"
If the remote branch has been updated by someone else, the push will be rejected, preventing accidental overwrites. It helps ensure that you do not overwrite someone elses work while working in collaboration.
